My Portfolio
Introduction
To create my portfolio, I first researched various portfolio designs for inspiration. This helped me understand the key elements and aesthetics that make a portfolio stand out.

Design Process
Choosing Colors: I selected the main colors for the website to establish a cohesive visual theme.
Designing the Main Page:
Header: I started with the header, creating a logo using my name.
Navbar: I completed the navigation bar with relevant links and content.
About Me
I introduced myself and my professional background. To make the introduction more personal, I included a picture that represents me and blended it with the background using Canva.

Call-to-Action Buttons
I created two call-to-action buttons: "Let's Talk" and "Hire Me." These buttons were particularly time-consuming due to the animations I incorporated.

Social Media Links
I added links to my professional social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

Home Page Content
I concluded the home page by showcasing my projects and explaining my skills in web design, development, coding, and creating CVs.

This structured approach ensured a clear, engaging, and professional portfolio presentation.
